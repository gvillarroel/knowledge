Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by
integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG
system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation
benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence
sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated
multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense question answer(QA) pairs, and
their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-
level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge
retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively
evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover,
HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing
the overall performance of RAG systems.

1 Introduction
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances the quality of LLM responses to questions beyond their
training corpus by flexibly integrating external knowledge through the retrieval of relevant content chunks as
prompts[Lewis et al., 2020]. This approach helps reduce hallucinations[Chen et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2025],
especially when dealing with real-time information[He et al., 2022] and specialized domain knowledge[Wang
et al., 2023, Li et al., 2023]. Document chunking, a crucial component of RAG systems, significantly impacts
the quality of retrieved knowledge and, consequently, the quality of responses. Poor chunking methods may
separate continuous fragments, leading to information loss, or combine unrelated information, making it
more challenging to retrieve relevant content. For instance, as noted in Bhat et al. [2025], the optimal chunk
size varies significantly across different datasets.
Although numerous benchmarks exist for evaluating RAG systems[Bai et al., 2024, Dasigi et al., 2021, Duarte
et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024, Yang et al., 2018, Koˇ cisk`y et al., 2018, Pang et al., 2021], they mostly focus on
assessing either the retriever’s capability or the reasoning ability of the response model, without effectively
evaluating chunking methods. We analyzed several datasets to determine the average word and sentence
count of evidence. As shown in Table 1, existing benchmarks generally suffer from evidence sparsity, where
only a few sentences in the document are relevant to the query. As illustrated in Figure 1, this sparsity of

evidence makes these datasets inadequate for evaluating the performance of chunking methods. In reality,
user tasks might be evidence-dense, such as enumeration or summarization tasks, requiring chunking
methods to accurately and completely segment semantically continuous fragments. Therefore, it is essential
to effectively evaluate chunking methods.
To address this, we introduceHierarchicalChunking Benchmark(HiCBench), a benchmark for document
QA designed to effectively evaluate the impact of chunking methods on different components of RAG
systems, including the performance of document chunking, retrievers, and response models. HiCBench’s
original documents are sourced from OHRBench. We curated documents of appropriate length for the
corpus and manually annotated chunking points at various hierarchical levels for evaluation purposes.
These points are used to assess the chunker’s performance and construct QA pairs, followed by using LLMs
and the annotated document structure to create evidence-dense QA, and finally extracting relevant evidence
sentences and filtering non-compliant samples using LLMs.
Additionally, existing document chunking methods only consider linear document structure[Duarte et al.,
2024, Xiao et al., 2024, Zhao et al., 2025, Wang et al., 2025], while user problems may involve fragments
with different semantic granularity, and linear document structure makes it difficult to adaptively adjust
during retrieval. Therefore, we propose theHierarchicalChunking framework(HiChunk), which employs
fine-tuned LLMs for hierarchical document structuring and incorporates iterative reasoning to address the
challenge of adapting to extremely long documents. For hierarchically structured documents, we introduce
the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm, which adaptively adjusts the granularity of retrieval chunks based on
the query, thereby maximizing retrieval quality.
In this work, our main contributions are as follows:
• We introduce HiCBench, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of chunker and the impact
of chunking methods on retrievers and response models within RAG systems. HiCBench includes
information on chunking points at different hierarchical levels of documents, as well as sources of
evidence and factual answers related to evidence-dense QA, enabling better evaluation of chunking
methods.
• We propose the HiChunk framework, a document hierarchical structuring framework that allows RAG
systems to dynamically adjust the semantic granularity of retrieval chunks.
• We conduct comprehensive performance evaluations on several open-source datasets and HiCBench,
analyzing the impact of different chunking methods across three dimensions: performance of chunker,
retriever, and responser.

2 Related Works
Traditional Text Chunking.Text chunking divides continuous text into meaningful units like sentences,
phrases, and words, with our focus on sentence-level chunking. Recent works have explored various
approaches: [Cho et al., 2022] combines text chunking with extractive summarization using hierarchical
representations and determinantal point processes (DPPs) to minimize redundancy, [Liu et al., 2021] presents
a pipeline integrating topical chunking with hierarchical summarization, and [Zhang et al., 2021] develops
an adaptive sliding-window model for ASR transcripts using phonetic embeddings. However, these LSTM
and BERT[Devlin et al., 2019] based methods face limitations from small context windows and single-level
chunking capabilities.
RAG-oriented Document Chunking.Recent research has explored content-aware document chunking
strategies for RAG systems. LumberChunker[Duarte et al., 2024] uses LLMs to identify semantic shifts,but
may miss hierarchical relationships. PIC[Wang et al., 2025] proposes pseudo-instruction for document
chunking, guide chunking via document summaries, though its single-level approach may oversimplify
document structure. AutoChunker[Jain et al., 2025] employs tree-based representations but primarily fo-
cuses on noise reduction rather than multi-level granularity. Late Chunking[Günther et al., 2024] embeds
entire documents before chunking to preserve global context, but produces flat chunk lists without mod-
eling hierarchical relationships. In contrast, our HierarchyChunk method creates multi-level document
representations, chunking from coarse sections to fine-grained paragraphs. This enables RAG systems to
retrieve information at appropriate abstraction levels, effectively bridging fragmented knowledge gaps and
providing comprehensive document understanding.
Limitations of Existing Text Chunking Benchmarks.The evaluation of text chunking and RAG methods
heavily relies on benchmark datasets. Wiki-727[Koshorek et al., 2018],VT-SSum[Lv et al., 2021] and News-
Net[Wu et al., 2023] are typically chunked into flat sequences of paragraphs or sentences, without capturing
the multi-level organization (e.g., sections, subsections, paragraphs) inherent in many real-world documents.
This single-level representation limits the ability to evaluate chunking methods that aim to preserve or
leverage document hierarchy, which is crucial for comprehensive knowledge retrieval in complex RAG
scenarios. While Qasper[Dasigi et al., 2021], HotpotQA[Yang et al., 2018] and GutenQA[Duarte et al., 2024]
are designed for RAG-related tasks, they do not specifically provide mechanisms or metrics for evaluating
the efficacy of document chunking strategies themselves. Their focus is primarily on end-to-end RAG
performance, where the impact of chunking is implicitly measured through retrieval and generation quality.
This makes it challenging to isolate and assess the performance of different chunking methods independently,
hindering systematic advancements in hierarchical document chunking. Our work addresses these gaps
by proposing a method that explicitly considers multi-level document chunking and constructs a novel
benchmark from a chunking perspective.
3 HiCBench Construction
In order to construct the HiCBench dataset, we performed additional document hierarchical structuring
and created QA pairs to evaluate document chunking quality, building on the OHRBench document
corpus[Zhang et al., 2024]. We filter documents with fewer than 4,000 words and those exceeding 50 pages.
For retained documents, we manually annotated the hierarchical structure and used these annotations to
assist in the generation of QA pairs and to assess the accuracy of document chunking.
Task CriteriaTo ensure that the constructed QA pairs could effectively evaluate the quality of document
chunking, we aimed for the evidence associated with each QA pair to be widely distributed across a complete

semantic chunk. Failure to fully recall such a semantic chunk would result in missing evidence, thereby
degrading the quality of the generated responses. To achieve this objective, we established the following
standards to regulate the generation of QA pairs:
• Evidence Completeness and Density: Evidence completeness ensures that the evidence relevant to the
question is comprehensive and necessary within the context. Evidence density requires that evidence
constitutes a significant proportion of the context, enhancing the QA pair’s utility for evaluating
chunking methods.
• Fact Consistency: To ensure the constructed samples can evaluate the entire retrieval-based pipeline, it
is essential that the generated responses remain consistent with the answers when provided with full
context, and that the questions are answerable.
Task DefinitionAdditionally, we define three different task types to evaluate the quality of chunking:
• Evidence-Sparse QA (T0): The evidence related to the QA is confined to one or two sentences within
the document.
• Single-Chunk Evidence-Dense QA (T1): Evidence sentences related to the QA constitute a substantial
portion of the context within a single complete semantic chunk. The size of chunk between 512 and
4096 words.
• Multi-Chunk Evidence-Dense QA (T2): Evidence sentences related to the QA are distributed across
multiple complete semantic chunks, covering a significant portion of the context. The size of chunk
between 256 and 2048 words.
QA ConstructionWe use a prompt-based approach using DeepSeek-R1-0528 to generate candidate QA
pairs, followed by a series of filtering processes to ensure the retained QA pairs meet the criteria of evidence
completeness, density, and fact consistency. The specific process is as follows:
1. Document Hierarchical Annotation and Summarization: To enable LLMs to gain an overall under-
standing of the specific document D while constructing QA pairs, we first generated summaries for
corresponding sections based on the annotated hierarchical structure, denoted asS←LLM s(D). These
summaries will be used in QA pair generation.
2. Generation of Questions and Answers: We randomly selected one or two chunks from all eligible
document fragments as context C, then generated candidate QA pairs using (S, C), where (Q, A)←
LLM qa(S,C).
3. Ensuring Evidence Completeness and Density: Referring to Friel et al. [2024], we use LLMs to
extracted sentences from context C related to the QA pair as evidence, denoted asE←LLM ee(C, Q, A).
To mitigate hallucination effects, this step will be repeated five times, retaining sentences that appeared
at least four times as the final evidence. Furthermore, to ensure evidence density, we remove samples
which the ratio of evidence is less than 10% of contextC.
4. Ensuring Fact Consistency: We applied Fact-Cov metric[Xiang et al., 2025] to filter test samples. We
first extract the facts from answer A, denoted as F←LLM f e(Q, A)1. Contexts C used for constructing
QA pairs will be provided to LLMs to generate response R′, denoted as R′ ←LLM r(Q, C). Then, the
Fact-Cov metric will be calculated byFact_Cov←LLM f c(F, R′)1. This process will be repeated 5 times.
We retain samples with an average Fact-Cov metric exceeding 80%. Samples below this threshold are
deemed unanswerable. All prompts used for QA construction are provided in subsection A.3.

4 Methodology
This section primarily introduces the HiChunk framework. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2.
The aim is for the fine-tuned LLMs to comprehend the hierarchical relationships within a document and
ultimately organize the document into a hierarchical structure. This involves two subtasks: identification
of chunking points and determination of hierarchy levels. Through prompt, HiChunk converts these two
subtasks into text generation task. In model train of HiChunk, we use Gov-report[Huang et al., 2021],
Qasper[Dasigi et al., 2021] and Wiki-727[Koshorek et al., 2018] to construct training instructions, which
are publicly available datasets with explicit document structure. Meanwhile, we augment the training set
by randomly shuffling document chapters and deleting document content. During inference, HiChunk
begins by processing document D with sentence chunking, assigning each sentence an independent ID,
resulting in S[1 :N] , where N is the number of sentences. Through HiChunk, the document’s global chunk
points GCP1:k are obtained, denoted as GCP1:k ←HiChunk(S[ 1 :N]) , with k being the maximum number of
predicted chunk point levels, and GCPi representing all chunk points at level i. Additionally, an iterative
inference optimization strategy is proposed to handle the structuring of extremely long documents.
Although the HiChunk hierarchical tree structure has semantic integrity, the variability in the chunk length
distribution caused by the semantic chunking method can lead to disparities in semantic granularity, which
can affect retrieval quality. To mitigate this, we apply a fixed-size chunking approach on the results of
HiChunk to produce C[1 :M] , and propose the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to balance issues of varying
semantic granularity and the semantic integrity of retrieved chunks.
Iterative InferenceFor documents that exceed the predefined inference input length L, an iterative
inference approach is required. The process begins by initializing the start sentence id of the current iteration
as a= 0 and determining the end sentence id b to ensure the constructed input length is less than the
maximum predefined length L. This is optimally set as b=arg max ˆb(S[a: ˆb]<L) . Through this setup, local
chunk points LCP1:k ←HiChunk(S[a:b]) are obtained via inference. These local chunk points LCP1:k are
then merged into the global chunk points GCP1:k. Based on these local inference results, the new value of a is
determined for the next iteration. This iterative process continues until a=N , signifying the completion of
inference for the entire document. However, iterative inference suffers from hierarchical drift when there is
only one level 1 chunk in the local inference result. To mitigate this problem, we construct residual text lines
from known document structures to guide the model making correct hierarchical judgments. The complete
iterative inference procedure is illustrated in algorithm 1.

Auto-Merge Retrieval AlgorithmTo balance the semantic richness and completeness of recalled contexts,
we propose Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm. This algorithm uses a series of conditions to control the extent to
which child nodes are merged upward into parent nodes. Auto-Merge algorithm traverses the query-ranked
chunks Csorted
[1:M] , using noderet to record the nodes that have been recalled. During the i-th step of the traversal,
we first record the current used token budget, tkcur = ∑n∈noderet len(n). We then add Csorted
[i] to noderet and
denote the parent ofC sorted
[i] byp. Finally, we merge upward when the following conditions are met:
•Cond 1: The intersection between the children of p and noderet contains at least two elements, denoted
as ∑n∈noderet 1(n∈p.children)≥2.
•Cond 2: The text length of the nodes in noderet belonging to p’s children is greater than or equal to θ∗,
denoted as ∑n∈(noderet ∩p.children) len(n)≥θ ∗. Here, θ∗ is an adaptively adjusted threshold, defined as
θ∗(tkcur, p) = len(p)
3 ×( 1 + tkcur
T ). As tkcur increases, θ∗ gradually increases from len(p)
3 to 2×len(p)
3 . This
means that higher-ranking chunks are more likely to merge upward.
•Cond 3: The remaining token budget is greater than the length of the chunk corresponding top, denoted
asT−tk cur ≥len(p).
The entire retrieval algorithm process is illustrated in algorithm 2.

HiChunk
5.1 Datasets and Metrics
The test subsets of Gov-report[Huang et al., 2021] and Qasper[Dasigi et al., 2021] datasets will be used for
evaluation of chunking accuracy. For the Gov-report dataset, we only retain documents with document
word count greater than 5k for experiments. To evaluate the accuracy of the chunking points, we use the F1
metrics of the chunking points. The F1L1 and F1L2 correspond to the chunking points of the level 1 and level
2 chunks, respectively. And the F1Lall metric does not consider the level of the chunking point. The Qasper,
GutenQA[Duarte et al., 2024], and OHRBench[Zhang et al., 2024] datasets contain evidence relevant to the
question. These datasets will be used in the evaluation for context retrieval.
For the full RAG pipeline evaluation, we used the publicly available datasets LongBench[Bai et al., 2024],
Qasper, GutenQA, and OHRBench. the LongBench RAG evaluation contains 8 subsets from different
datasets, with a total of 1,550 qa pairs, which can be categorized into single document qa and multiple
document qa. The Qasper dataset contains 1,372 qa pairs from 416 documents. The GutenQA dataset
contains 3,000 qa pairs based on 100 documents. In GutenQA, the average number of words in a document is
146,506, which is significantly higher than the other datasets. The documents of OHRBench come from seven
different areas. We keep the documents with word counts greater than 4k in OHRBench and use the original
qa pairs corresponding to these documents as a representative of the task T0, denoted as OHRBench(T0). We
use the F1 score and Rouge metrics to assess the quality of LLM responses. All experiments are conducted in
the code repository of LongBench1.
Furthermore, HiCBench will be used for comprehensive evaluation, including chunking accuracy, evidence
recall rate, and RAG response quality assessment. To avoid biases from sparse text quality evaluation
metrics, we employ the Fact-Cov[Xiang et al., 2025] metric for response quality evaluation of HiCBench. The
Fact-Cov metric is repeatedly calculated 5 times to take the average. Statistics information of datasets used
in experiment are shown in Table 2.

5.2 Comparison Methods
We primarily compared tow types of chunking methods: rule-based chunking methods and semantic-based
chunking methods. All the comparison methods are as follows:
• FC200: Fixed chunking is a rule-based method, which first divide the document into sentences and
then merge sentences based on a fixed chunking size. Here, the fixed chunking size is 200.
• SC: Semantic chunker[Xiao et al., 2024] uses an embedding model to calculate the similarity between
adjacent paragraphs for chunking. We use bge-large-en-v1.5[Xiao et al., 2024] as the embedding model.

## PDF page 8

HiChunk
• LC: LumberChunker[Duarte et al., 2024] employs LLMs to predict the positions for chunking. In our
experiments, we use Deepseek-r1-0528[DeepSeek-AI, 2025] as the prediction model. The sampling
temperature set to 0.1.
• HC200: Hierarchical chunker is the proposed method. In the model training for HiChunk. We further
chunk the chunks of HiChunk by the fixed chunking method. The fixed chunking size is set to 200,
denoted as HC200.
•HC200+AM: "+AM" represents the result of introducing Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm on the basis
of HC200.
5.3 Experimental Settings
In the model training of HiChunk, Gov-report[Huang et al., 2021], Qasper[Dasigi et al., 2021] and Wiki-
727[Koshorek et al., 2018] are the train datasets, which are publicly available datasets with explicit document
structure. We use Qwen3-4B[Team, 2025] as the base model, with a learning rate of 1e-5 and a batch size of
64. The maximum length of training and inference is set to 8192 and 16384 tokens, respectively. Meanwhile,
the length of each sentence is limited to within 100 characters. Due to the varying sizes of chunks resulting
from semantic-based chunking, we limit the length of the retrieved context based on the number of tokens
rather than the number of chunks for a fair comparison. The maximum length of the retrieved context is set
to 4096 tokens. We also compare the performance of different chunking methods under different retrieved
context length settings in subsection 5.6. In the RAG evaluation process, we consistently use Bge-m3[Chen
et al., 2024] as the embedding model for context retrieval. As for the response model, we use three different
series of LLMs with varying scales: Llama3.1-8b[Dubey et al., 2024], Qwen3-8b, and Qwen3-32b[Team, 2025].
5.4 Chunking Accuracy
To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the semantic-based chunking method, we conducted
experiments using two publicly available datasets, along with the proposed benchmark, to assess the cut-
point accuracy of the chunking method. Since the SC and LC chunking methods are limited to performing
single-level chunking, we evaluated only the F1 scores for the initial level of chunking points and the
F1 scores without regard for the hierarchy of chunking points. The evaluation results are presented in
Table 3. In the Qasper and Gov-report datasets, which serve as in-domain test sets, the HC method shows a
significant improvement in chunk accuracy compared to the SC and LC methods. Additionally, in HiCBench,
an out-of-domain test set, the HC method exhibits even more substantial accuracy improvements. These
findings demonstrate that HC enhances the base model’s performance in document chunking by focusing
exclusively on the chunking task. Moreover, as indicated in the subsequent experimental results presented
in subsection 5.5, the accuracy improvement of the HC method in document chunking leads to enhanced
performance throughout the RAG pipeline. This includes improvements in the quality of evidence retrieval
and model responses.

5.5 RAG-pipeline Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of various chunking methods on the LongBench, Qasper, GutenQA, OHRBench
and HiCBench datasets, with the results detailed in Table 4. The performance of each subset in LongBench
is shown in Table A1. The results demonstrate that the HC200+AM method achieves either optimal or
suboptimal performance on most LongBench subsets. When considering average scores, LumberChunk
remains a strong baseline. However, as noted in Table 2, both GutenQA and OHRBench datasets exhibit
the feature of evidence sparsity, meaning that the evidence related to QA pairs is derived from only a few
sentences within the document. Consequently, the different chunking methods show minimal variation
in evidence recall and response quality metrics on these datasets. For instance, using Qwen3-32B as the
response model on the GutenQA dataset, the evidence recall metrics of FC200 and HC200+AM are 64.5 and
65.53, and the Rouge metrics are 44.86 and 44.94, respectively. Another example is OHRBench dataset, the
evidence recall metrics and Rouge metrics of FC200, LC, HC200 and HC200+AM are very close. In contrast,
the Qasper and HiCBench datasets contain denser evidence, where a better chunking method results in
higher evidence recall and improved response quality. Again using Qwen3-32B as an example, on theT1 task
of HiCBench dataset, the evidence recall metric for FC200 and HC200+AM are 74.06 and 81.03, the Fact-Cov
metrics are 63.20 and 68.12, and the Rouge metrics are 35.70 and 37.29, respectively. These findings suggest
that the evidence-dense QA in the HiCBench dataset is better suited for evaluating the quality of chunking
methods, enabling researchers to more effectively identify bottlenecks within the overall RAG pipeline.

5.6 Influence of Retrieval Token Budget
Since HiCBench is more effective in assessing the performance of chunking methods, we evaluated the
impact of our proposed method on the T1 task of HiCBench under different retrieve token budgets: 2k, 2.5k,
3k, 3.5k and 4k tokens. We compared the effects of various chunking methods by calculating the Rouge
metrics between responses and answers, as well as the Fact-Cov metrics. The experimental findings are
illustrated in Figure 3. The results demonstrate that a larger retrieval token budget usually leads to better
response quality, so it is necessary to compare different chunking methods under the same retrieval token
budget. HC200+AM consistently achieves superior response quality across various retrieve token budget

5.7 Effect of Maximum Hierarchical Level
In this section, we examine the impact of limiting the maximum hierarchical level of document structure
obtained by HiChunk. The maximum level ranges from 1 to 4, denoted as L1 to L4, while LA represents no
limitation on the maximum level. We measure the evidence recall metric on different settings. As shown
in Figure 4. This result reveals that the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm degrades the performance of RAG
system in the L1 setting due to the overly coarse-grained semantics of L1 chunks. As the maximum level
increases from 1 to 3, the evidence recall metric also gradually improves and remains largely unchanged
thereafter. These findings highlight the importance of document hierarchical structure for enchancing RAG
systems.

5.8 Time Cost for Chunking
As document chunking is essential for RAG systems, it must meet specific timeliness requirements. In this
section, we analyze the time costs associated with different semantic-based chunking methods, as presented
in Table 5. Although the SC method exhibits superior real-time performance, it consistently falls short
in quality across various datasets compared to other baselines. However, the LC method demonstrates
reasonably good performance, but its chunking speed is considerably slower than other semantic-based
methods, limiting its applicability within RAG systems. In contrast, the HC method achieves the highest
chunking quality among all baseline methods while maintaining an acceptable time cost, making it well
suited for implementation in real scenarios RAG systems.

6 Conclusion
This paper begins by analyzing the shortcomings of current benchmarks used for evaluating RAG systems,
specifically highlighting how evidence sparsity makes them unsuitable for assessing different chunking
methods. As a solution, we introduce HiCBench, a QA benchmark focused on hierarchical document
chunking, which effectively evaluates the impact of various chunking methods on the entire RAG process.
Additionally, we propose the HiChunk framework, which, when combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval
algorithm, significantly enhances the quality of chunking, retrieval, and model responses compared to other
baselines.

A.2 Evidence Recall under Different Token Budget
In this section, we further present the curve of evidence recall metric at different retrieval context length
settings (from 2k to 4k). The results are shown in Figure A1. Compared with other chunking methods, the
HC200+AM method always maintains the best performance.

Listing A1: Prompt for segment summarization.
** Task :**
You are tasked with a n a l y z i n g the pr ov ide d d ocu me nt s ec ti on s and their h i e r a r c h i c a l
s t r u c t u r e . Your goal is to g ene ra te a concise and i n f o r m a t i v e p a r a g r a p h d e s c r i b i n g the
content of each section and s u b s e c t i o n .
** I n s t r u c t i o n s :**
1. Each section or s u b s e c t i o n is i d e n t i f i e d by a header in the format ‘=== SECTION xxx === ‘
( for example , ‘=== SECTION 1=== ‘ , ‘=== SECTION 2.1=== ‘ , etc .) .
2. For every section and subsection , write a brief , clear , and i n f o r m a t i v e p a r a g r a p h
s u m m a r i z i n g its content . Do not omit any section or s u b s e c t i o n .
3. Present your output as a JSON object with the f o l l o w i n g s t r u c t u r e :
‘‘‘ json
{
" SECTION 1": " d e s c r i p t i o n of section 1" ,
" SECTION 1.1": " d e s c r i p t i o n of section 1.1" ,
...
" SECTION n . m ": " d e s c r i p t i o n of section n . m "
}
‘‘‘
4. Ensure that each key in the JSON object matches the exact section i d e n t i f i e r ( e . g . ,
‘" SECTION 2.1.3" ‘) , and do not include any se ct io ns or s u b s e c t i o n s that are not
present in the pro vi de d do cu me nt f ra gme nt .
5. Do not add any c o m m e n t a r y or e x p l a n a t i o n outside the JSON object .

You are pr ov id ed with a d oc ume nt that in cl ud es a de ta il ed s t r u c t u r e of se cti on s and
subsections , along with d e s c r i p t i o n s for each . Additionally , c om pl et e co nt ent s are
pr ov id ed for a few s ele ct ed s ec ti on s . Your task is to create a qu es ti on and answer pair
that e f f e c t i v e l y ca pt ur es the essence of the s el ec ted se cti on s . Finally , you need to
extract the facts which are m e n t i o n e d in the answer .
< Type of G e n e r a t e d Q & A Task : Evidence - dense D e p e n d e n t U n d e r s t a n d i n g task >
U n d e r s t a n d i n g task means that , the g e n e r a t e d question - a n s w e r i n g pairs that require the
r e s p o n s e r to extract i n f o r m a t i o n from d o c u m e n t s . The answer should be able to find
di re ct ly in the d o c u m e n t s without any r e a s o n i n g .
Evidence - dense d e p e n d e n t means that the facts about g e n e r a t e d qu est io n are wildly
d i s t r i b u t e d across all parts of the r e t r i e v e d s ec tio ns .
< Criteria >
- The q ue st ion MUST be de ta il ed and be based e x p l i c i t l y on i n f o r m a t i o n in the d oc um en t .
- The q ue st ion MUST include at least one entity .
- Q ue sti on must not contain any a m b i g u o u s references , such as ’he ’ , ’ she ’ , ’it ’ , ’ the
report ’ , ’ the paper ’ , and ’ the document ’. You MUST use their co mp le te names .
- The context s en te nc e the qu es ti on is based on MUST include the name of the entity . For
example , an u n a c c e p t a b l e context is " He won a bronze medal in the 4 * 100 m relay ". An
a c c e p t a b l e context is " Nils S a n d s t r o m was a Swedish spr in te r who co mp et ed at the 1920
Summer O ly mpi cs ."
- ** THE MOST I M P O R T A N T : Evidence - dense d e p e n d e n c y ** , Q u e s t i o n s must require u n d e r s t a n d i n g
of ENTIRE s el ect ed sec ti on s . Never base Q & A on is ol at ed few s e n t e n c e s . For example , a
qu es ti on comply the ** Evidence - dense d e p e n d e n c y ** cr it er ia means that the facts about
this qu es tio n should be wildly d i s t r i b u t e d across all parts of the r e t r i e v e d se ct ion s .
< Output Format >
Your re sp ons e should be s t r u c t u r e d as follows :
