ABSTRACT
Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge.
It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.
Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently un-
derperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question:
Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide
measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-
Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models on
both hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-
Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, covering
fact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarize, and creative generation,
and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph construction
and knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we
systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional
RAG and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical
application. All related resources and analysis are collected for the community at

1 INTRODUCTION
Large language models (LLMs), like Claude (Anthropic, 2024) and GPT (OpenAI, 2023) series,
have surprised the world with their remarkable capabilities in many real-world tasks, like linguistic
comprehension (Brown et al., 2020), question answering (Khashabi et al., 2020), mathematical
reasoning (Hong et al., 2025), and content generation (Chowdhery et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024;
Zhang et al., 2024a). Despite the success, LLMs are always criticized for their inability to handle
knowledge-intensive tasks and the tendency to generate hallucinations (Huang et al., 2023), especially
when faced with questions requiring specialized expertise (Chen et al., 2024b; He et al., 2024; Tan
et al., 2024). Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Gao et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020) has recently
offered a promising approach to adapt LLMs for specific or private domains. Rather than retraining
LLMs to incorporate new knowledge and updates (Feng et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2025; Jiang et al.,
2025; Wang et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2025b), RAG enhances these models by leveraging external
knowledge from text corpora. This approach enables LLMs to generate responses by leveraging not
only their parametric knowledge but also real-time retrieved domain-specific information, thereby
providing more accurate and reliable answers (Chen et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024).
However, traditional RAG systems often face critical challenges when dealing with large-scale,
unstructured domain corpora (Edge et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2024). The textual documents in this
corpus, collected from different sources, like research papers, textbooks and technical reports, often

vary widely in accuracy and completeness (Guo et al., 2025). The information retrieved by RAG
systems can be extensive, complex, and lack clear organization, since domain knowledge is typically
scattered across multiple documents without clear hierarchical relationships between different con-
cepts (Sun et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024b; Ma et al., 2024). Although RAG systems (Borgeaud
et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) attempt to manage this complexity by dividing
documents into smaller chunks for effective indexing, this approach inadvertently sacrifices crucial
contextual information, significantly compromising retrieval accuracy and contextual comprehension
for complex reasoning (Han et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a; Shengyuan et al., 2024).
To address this, graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) (Zhang et al., 2025a; Peng et al.,
2024; Procko & Ochoa, 2024) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages external
structured graphs to improve LLMs’ capability on contextual comprehension (Han et al., 2024;
Zhang et al., 2025a). Early efforts, like Microsoft GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024) and its variant
LazyGraphRAG (Darren Edge, 2024), employ hierarchical community-based search and combine
local/global querying for comprehensive responses. Building on this, LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024)
improves scalability through dual-level retrieval and graph-enhanced indexing, while GRAG (Hu
et al., 2024) introduces a soft pruning technique to mitigate the impact of irrelevant entities in retrieved
subgraphs and employs graph-aware prompt tuning to help LLMs interpret topological structure.
Further extending these capabilities, StructRAG (Li et al., 2024) tailors data structures to specific
tasks by dynamically selecting optimal graph schemas, while KAG (Liang et al., 2024) constructs
domain expert knowledge using conceptual semantic reasoning and human-annotated schemas, which
significantly reduces noise present in OpenIE systems. These strategies used in GraphRAG models
significantly improve retrieval precision and contextual depth, enabling LLMs to address complex,
multi-hop queries more effectively.
Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies (Han et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025) report that
GraphRAG models frequently underperform traditional RAG approaches on many real-world tasks.
Specifically, the previous study (Han et al., 2025) demonstrates that GraphRAG achieves 13.4% lower
accuracy on Natural Question compared to vanilla RAG, with particularly poor performance on time-
sensitive queries (e.g., 16.6% accuracy drop for questions requiring real-time knowledge updates).
While graph retrieval improves reasoning depth by 4.5% on HotpotQA’s multi-hop questions, it
introduces 2.3 × higher latency on average (Zhou et al., 2025). These inconsistencies between
conceptual potential and practical efficacy raise critical questions:Is GraphRAG really effective,
and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems?
It is crucial to identify the factors that are currently limiting GraphRAG’s real-world performance.
However, quantitatively and fairly assessing the role of graph structures in RAG systems is challenging.
Current benchmarks, including HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MultiHopRAG (Tang & Yang, 2024)
and UltraDomain (Qian et al., 2024), fail to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of graph structures in
RAG systems due to fundamental limitations in both their problem design and corpus composition.❶
First, existing benchmarkslack granular differentiation in task complexity. Existing benchmarks
overemphasize retrieval difficulty, locating scattered facts from corpora, while neglecting reasoning
complexity, which involves synthesizing interconnected facts into contextually grounded solutions. As
shown in Figure 2, they predominantly focus on narrow task categories, such as simple fact retrieval or
linear multi-hop reasoning, without systematically capturing the spectrum of challenges encountered
in real-world scenarios (Tang & Yang, 2024). For instance, a typical multi-hop question in existing
benchmarks might ask, “Who founded Company Kjaer Weis , and in which city was this person
born¿‘ This requires only the extraction of several discrete facts and cannot extend to complex
scenarios requiring hierarchical reasoning and contextual synthesis. ❷ Second, corpora in existing
RAG benchmarks suffer frominconsistent quality and low information density. Many datasets
are built on generic sources like Wikipedia or news articles, which lack domain-specific knowledge
or explicit logical connections. While some work, like UltraDomain (Qian et al., 2024), has tried
to extract domain-specific corpora from textbooks, they often fail to encode implicit hierarchies for
real-world applications. This makes it impossible to assess GraphRAG’s core strengths in leveraging
domain hierarchies. For example, a corpus with poorly defined conceptual hierarchies or loosely
connected entities cannot meaningfully test whether graph-aware retrieval mechanisms improve
multi-hop reasoning or preserve contextual coherence during knowledge acquisition. Additionally,
the absence of corpora with varying information densities, ranging from tightly structured domain
knowledge to loosely organized real-world documents, further restricts the evaluation of graph
structures’ scalability and adaptability.

To bridge this gap, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models on deep reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features ❶ comprehensive corporawith
different information density, including tightly structured domain knowledge and loosely organized
texts, and❷tasks of increasing difficulty, covering fact retrieval, multi-hop reasoning, Contextual
Summarize, and creative generation, and ❸ systematic evaluationacross the entire pipeline, from
graph construction and knowledge retrieval to final generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we
systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG systems and
the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.
2 PRELIMINARYSTUDY
Before going into the details of our benchmark, we first examine the pipelines of RAG and GraphRAG,
and conduct a comprehensive study to identify the primary limitation of existing benchmarks.
2.1 RAGVS. GRAPHRAG
We carefully compare GraphRAG’s pipeline with traditional RAG’s and summarize their characteris-
tics in Figure 1. Generally, RAG retrieves contextually relevant data from a corpus during inference,
enabling real-time, domain-specific responses without model retraining. While efficient, its reliance
on direct semantic similarity may overlook the broader contextual web of relationships, hierarchies,
or implicit logic that binds concepts together. GraphRAG addresses this limitation by expanding
the retrieval framework beyond semantic relevance. It structures background knowledge as a graph,
where nodes represent entities, events, or themes, and edges define their logical, causal, or associative
connections. When processing a query, GraphRAG retrieves not only directly related nodes but
also traverses the graph to capture interconnected subgraphs, uncovering latent patterns such as
thematic evolution, indirect dependencies, or multi-step reasoning chains. This approach enables
the model to synthesize insights from dispersed data points, making it particularly good at tasks
demanding complex logical inference. For instance, while RAG might retrieve isolated facts about a
topic, GraphRAG could identify related events, causal chains, or thematic clusters, thereby enabling
more coherent and comprehensive responses. To sum up, the primary distinction between these two
paradigms lies in their handling of contextual depth. RAG excels in scenarios requiring rapid access
to discrete information, while GraphRAG emphasizes deep contextual analysis for tasks requiring
nuanced understanding of interconnected data. More detailed analysis is included in Appendix I.
2.2 CURRENTRAG BENCHMARKS
Existing benchmarks, such as HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MultiHopRAG (Tang & Yang, 2024)
and UltraDomain (Qian et al., 2024), were primarily designed to evaluate traditional text-centric
RAG frameworks. While these benchmarks have advanced the field, they exhibit critical limitations
when applied to assessing GraphRAG.

First, existing benchmarks narrowly focus on testing retrieval difficulty , the ability to
locate scattered information from the corpus, while neglecting the equally critical challenge of
reasoning difficulty , which involves integrating interconnected concepts/facts by capturing
the latent logic. While these benchmarks include “multi-hop“ questions to test a model’s ability in
complex reasoning, they do not reflect real-world scenarios demanding complex logical synthesis.
For instance, a typical multi-hop question in existing benchmarks might ask, “Who founded Company
Kjaer Weis , and in which city was this person born?” This requires only the extraction of several
discrete facts from the corpus. However, real-world problems, such as explaining why Company
Kjaer Weis failed in a specific market, demand synthesizing financial reports, competitor analyses,
consumer trends, and regulatory changes into a coherent narrative. GraphRAG’s strength lies in
mapping these interdependencies (e.g., “Market entry timing→ supply chain disruptions→ regulatory
fines → brand erosion”) through graph traversals. However, current benchmarks lack tasks that
explicitly require such synthesis, reducing “multi-hop” queries to sequential fact retrieval within
narrow contexts, failing to evaluate how models infer domain-specific hierarchies.

Second, the corpora used in existing
benchmarks suffer from inconsistent
quality and low information density.
Most datasets are built on generic
sources like Wikipedia or news arti-
cles, which lack structured domain-
specific knowledge or explicit logical
connections. A corpus with poorly de-
fined conceptual hierarchies or loosely
connected entities cannot meaning-
fully test whether graph-aware re-
trieval mechanisms improve multi-
hop reasoning or preserve contextual
coherence during knowledge integra-
tion. While some work, like UltraDo-
main, has tried to construct domain-
specific corpora using textbooks, they
often fail to encode implicit hierar-
chies for real-world applications. As shown in Table 2 and Table 13 in Appendix E, domain
concepts and their hierarchical dependency appear sparsely in the corpus. This sparsity falls far
below the threshold of multi-hop reasoning, which makes it impossible to assess GraphRAG’s core
strengths in leveraging domain hierarchies. Additionally, the absence of corpora with varying infor-
mation densities, ranging from tightly structured domain knowledge to loosely organized real-world
documents, further restricts the evaluation of graph structures’ scalability.
Third, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating GraphRAG since their evaluation metrics focus
solely on the final outputs, answer accuracy or fluency, while treating GraphRAG’s internal processes
(graph construction, retrieval, and generation) as black boxes. Such evaluations can hardly measure
how graph structures contribute to the retrieval and reasoning processes. To truly assess GraphRAG,
a more holistic evaluation is necessary, encompassing the entire pipeline. This includes examining

the efficiency of graph construction and the quality of the resulting graph, the structure and relevance
of the knowledge retrieved via the graph, and finally, the faithfulness of the generated answer to this
graph-derived context. Such a comprehensive view is essential to understand the actual impact and
benefits of graph structures within retrieval augmented generation systems. Detailed corpus statistics
and analysis for these benchmarks can be found in Section E of the Appendix.
3 GRAPHRAG-BENCH
In this section, we present GraphRAG-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess
GraphRAG systems through comprehensive task hierarchies and structured knowledge integration.
Specifically, GraphRAG-Bench consists a comprehensive dataset with (i) tasks of increasing difficulty,
covering fact retrieval, multi-hop reasoning, Contextual Summarize, and creative generation, and (ii)
real-world corpora with different information density, and (iii) a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph construction and knowledge retrieval to final generation.
3.1 TASKFORMULATION
Traditional benchmarks focus on tasks with simple fact retrieval or linear multi-hop reasoning, where
answers depend on linking concepts or facts across a limited set of documents. While these tasks test
a model’s ability to locate scattered information (retrieval difficulty), they do not reflect real-world
scenarios demanding complex logical synthesis (reasoning complexity). Our benchmark addresses
this gap by designing four different tasks that progressively scale both retrieval difficulty and reasoning
complexity. As shown in Table 1, these four tasks ensure more comprehensive evaluation: lower-level
tasks validate retrieval capability, while higher levels assess reasoning depth, ensuring models balance
precise fact extraction with clear contextual comprehension.
3.2 DATASETCONSTRUCTION
Corpus collection.Existing datasets often derive from generic sources like Wikipedia or news
articles, which, while broadly accessible, lack explicit logical connections and structured domain
expertise, unable to evaluate systems that require reasoning over implicit relationships or contextual
hierarchies. We address these issues by (i) integrating tightly structured domain data from NCCN
medical guidelines to embed explicit hierarchies and standardized protocols, which provide dense
conceptual relationships (e.g., treatment protocols linking symptoms, drugs, and outcomes) at scales
exceeding typical domain corpora, and (ii) collecting loosely organized texts (pre-20th-century
novels) from Gutenberg library to simulate real-world documents with implicit, non-linear narratives,
ensuring the corpus reflects the complexity of unstructured knowledge while minimizing pretraining
contamination. This combination ensures the corpus balances unstructured, real-world ambiguity with
domain-specific hierarchies, enabling rigorous evaluation of both retrieval robustness and reasoning
depth. We include more details about these datasets (Novel and Medical Datasets) in Appendix C.

Logic and evidence extraction.To overcome the superficial treatment of reasoning in existing bench-
marks, where multi-hop queries often reduce to linear fact retrieval, our framework systematically
transforms raw text into structured domain ontologies. These ontologies preserve not only entities
but also their contextual relationships and hierarchical dependencies, enabling the extraction of
fine-grained evidence that reflects both localized factual clusters and interconnected reasoning chains.
Where prior work struggles to represent latent logical synthesis (e.g., inferring causal pathways from
dispersed market factors), our evidence extraction process isolates self-contained subgraphs for basic
retrieval while reconstructing multi-hop relational sequences that expose deeper inferential patterns.
Question generation.we generate the questions according to the complexity of the underlying
evidence. Rather than treating difficulty as a function of factual scarcity or hop count, we calibrate
questions by progressively integrating evidence types, from isolated subgraph fragments for retrieval
tasks to global topology-aware reasoning for synthetic reasoning. This ensures that complex questions
necessitate not merely aggregating discrete facts but synthesizing contextual hierarchies and domain-
specific ontologies. By anchoring questions in structured evidence packages that mirror real-world
knowledge interdependencies, our benchmark evaluates how models derive insights from both explicit
logical frameworks and unstructured contextual ambiguity, thereby addressing the critical gap in
assessing reasoning depth beyond simple retrieval.
Relevance check and refinement.To ensure the accuracy and practical relevance of the dataset, we
implemented rigorous validation and refinement processes after initial construction. Full methodolog-
ical details are provided in Appendix C, while the visualization of our datasets is in Appendix E.
3.3 EVALUATIONMETRICS
Existing benchmarks primarily focus on the accuracy or fluency of final outputs, while how to
measure the graph’s contribution to the retrieval and reasoning processes remains an open challenge.
To address this, we design stage-specific metrics that evaluate the entire workflow from graph
construction and retrieval to final generation. In this section, we introduce these metrics accordingly.
Graph Quality.GraphRAG constructs graphs to represent the domain concepts and their relations,
which enables structured and effective knowledge organization. To evaluate its effectiveness, we
design structure-based metrics to assess the quality of graphs built in different GraphRAG.
•NODECOUNTquantifies the number of entities extracted during knowledge graph construction.
Higher values imply broader domain coverage and finer-grained knowledge representation.
•EDGECOUNTmeasures the number of relations among entities. Higher values indicate denser
semantic connectivity, facilitating multi-hop reasoning and complex query handling.
•AVERAGEDEGREEcaptures global connectivity by averaging the number of edges per node.
Higher values of AVERAGEDEGREEindicate more integrated knowledge representations, enabling
efficient cross-node traversal. It is computed as:
AVERAGEDEGREE= 1
|V|
X
v∈V
deg(v),(1)
whereVis the set of nodes, anddeg(v)is the degree of nodev.
•AVERAGECLUSTERINGCOEFFICIENTevaluates local neighborhood connectivity via triad
completion. Higher values, common in domain-specific clusters (e.g., disease–treatment–symptom in
medical graphs), indicate coherent subgraphs that support localized reasoning. It can be obtained by:
AVERAGECLUSTERINGCOEFFICIENT= 1
|V|
X
v∈V
C(v),C(v) = 2·T(v)
deg(v)·(deg(v)−1) .(2)
Here,C(v)is the clustering coefficient of nodev, withT(v)denoting its centered triangle number.
Retrieval Performance.To evaluate the retrieval performance of GraphRAG, we argue that an
effective system should not only ensure the completeness of retrieved information (i.e., high recall) but
also reduce irrelevant content (i.e., high relevance). We introduce two corresponding retrieval-quality-
based metrics: 1) CONTEXTRELEVANCEmeasures how well the retrieved content aligns with the

key metrics: 1) LEXICALOVERLAP: Measures word-level similarity between the generated and
reference answers using longest common subsequence matching. 2) ANSWERACCURACY: Assesses
both semantic similarity and factual consistency with the reference answer. 3) FAITHFULNESS:
Evaluates whether the relevant knowledge points in a long-form answer are faithful to the given
context. 4) EVIDENCECOVERAGE: Measures whether the answer adequately covers all knowledge
relevant to the question. We provide details of these widely used metrics in Appendix F.
4 EXPERIMENT
This section evaluates GraphRAG against RAG through comprehensive experiments on our new
benchmarks. We aim to address the following research questions:Q1(Generation Accuracy): How
does GraphRAG perform compared to RAG on our benchmark?Q2(Retrieval Performance): Does
GraphRAG retrieve higher-quality and less redundant information in the retrieval process?Q3
(Graph complexity): Does the constructed graph correctly organize the underlying knowledge?Q4
(Efficiency): Does GraphRAG introduce significant token overhead during retrieval?
4.1 GENERATIONACCURACY(Q1)
Figure 4: Retrieval and generation performance of
RAG and GraphRAG across four different tasks.
To address Q1, we evaluate seven representa-
tive GraphRAG frameworks on our benchmark,
using tailored metrics for different question
types. For Type 1 (retrieval) and Type 2 (reason-
ing) questions, we assess answer quality with
ROUGE scores and accuracy. For Type 3 (sum-
marization) questions, we introduce evidence
coverage to measure the comprehensiveness of
the generated answers. For Type 4 (creative gen-
eration) questions, we use faithfulness to assess
factual consistency. Main results in Table 3 and
Appendix G lead to following observations:

RAG’s straightforward retrieval method is sufficient, while GraphRAG’s extra graph-based processing
may introduce redundant or noisy information for simpler queries, degrading answer quality.
Obs.2 . GraphRAG excels in complex tasks: GraphRAG models show a clear advantage in complex
reasoning, Contextual Summarize, and creative generation. This is intuitive, as these tasks require
bridging the complex relations among multiple concepts, which is naturally a graph structure.
Obs.3 . GraphRAG ensures greater factual reliability in creative tasks: RAPTOR scores highest
in faithfulness (70.9%) on the novel dataset, though RAG covers more evidence (40.0%), likely
because GraphRAG’s fragmented knowledge retrieval and complicates broad scope generation. This
trade-off highlights GraphRAG’s strength in precision but limitations in wide-ranging synthesis.
4.2 RETRIEVALPERFORMANCE(Q2)
To quantitatively compare the retrieval effectiveness of the two paradigms, we adopt two comple-
mentary metrics: Evidence Recall, which measures how completely the retrieved context covers the
gold evidence, and Context Relevance, which measures the semantic alignment between the retrieved
content and the input query. As shown in Table 4 and Appendix G, we have the following observtions:
Obs.4 . RAG excels at retrieving discrete facts for simple questions that do not require complex
logics, achieving 83.2% Evidence Recall on the novel dataset (vs. HippoRAG2’s best Context
Relevance). Medical dataset results confirm this pattern, suggesting relevant evidence for Level 1
questions typically resides in single passages. It is because the graph used in GraphRAG introduces
several logically relevant but redundant information in these scenarios.
Obs.5 . GraphRAG’s advantages emerge clearly as questions grow more complex.For Level
2-3 questions on the novel dataset, HippoRAG achieves remarkable Evidence Recall (87.9-90.9%),
while HippoRAG2 leads in Context Relevance (85.8-87.8%). Medical dataset results reinforce this
trend, demonstrating GraphRAG’s unique ability to connect information across distant text segments,
crucial for multi-hop reasoning and comprehensive summarization.
Obs.6 . RAG and GraphRAG show a trade-off on creative tasks requiring broad knowledge
synthesis.Global-GraphRAG achieves superior Evidence Recall (83.1%), though RAG maintains
better Context Relevance (78.8%). While GraphRAG accesses more relevant information overall, its
retrieval approach naturally introduces some redundancy compared to RAG’s more focused results.
4.3 GRAPHCOMPLEXITY(Q3)
During the indexing phase, GraphRAG extracts entities and relations from the corpus to construct a
knowledge graph. By indexing over the graph structure, GraphRAG establishes logical and semantic
connections between the knowledge graph and the original context, resulting in a well-structured
and knowledge-complete index graph. To reveal the structural characteristics of the index graph and
8

highlight differences introduced by various GraphRAG, we introduce the following metrics: number
of nodes, number of edges, average degree, and average clustering coefficient.
Obs.7 . The index graphs generated by different GraphRAG implementations demonstrate
substantial structural variation.
Figure 5: The relational structure of different methods.
Table 5: The Graph statistics across RAG methods.

As illustrated in Figure 5, Hip-
poRAG2 produces significantly
denser graphs, with node and edge
counts that far surpass other frame-
works. Specifically, on the novel
dataset, HippoRAG2 has an average
of 2,310 edges and 523 nodes, while
on the medical dataset, it has an
average of 3,979 edges and 598
nodes (per 10k corpus tokens). This
enhanced graph density improves
both information connectivity and
coverage, ultimately contributing to
superior retrieval and generation capa-
bilities. This observation is consistent
with the retrieval performance, which
shows that HippoRAG2 achieves
higher recall than other baselines.
4.4 EFFICIENCY(Q4)
GraphRAG retrieves relevant knowl-
edge by traversing the constructed graph. While this approach allows for more structured knowledge
organization, it can also lead to a substantial increase in token cost. To better understand the associated
efficiency and cost implications, we conduct a dedicated analysis on prompt statistics across different
GraphRAG models.

Obs.8 . Compared to vanilla RAG,
GraphRAG significantly increases
prompt lengthdue to the additional
steps involved in knowledge retrieval
and graph-based aggregation. Specifi-
cally, MS-GraphRAG(global), which in-
corporates a community-summarization
mechanism, reaches a prompt size of
up to 4×10 4 tokens. LightRAG also
produces lengthy prompts ( ≈10 4 to-
kens). In contrast, HippoRAG2 main-
tains a more compact prompt size (≈10 3 tokens), showing better efficiency. These results highlight
that GraphRAG’s structured pipeline incurs non-trivial token overhead.
Obs.9 . As task complexity and the number of required knowledge points increase, GraphRAG’s
prompt length exhibits a clear upward trend. Notably, MS-GraphRAG(global)’s prompt size
expands from 7,800 to 40,000 tokens across tasks of increasing difficulty. This excessive token
accumulation often introduces redundant information, which in turn degrades context relevance
during retrieval. These findings underscore a critical trade-off: while GraphRAG improves retrieval
breadth, it may also introduce noisy context due to prompt inflation, especially in complex tasks.
5 CONCLUSION
Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) emerges as a pioneering approach that
introduces graph structures to explicitly model entity relationships and hierarchical dependencies,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval. Despite its conceptual promise, empirical
studies report that GraphRAG often fails to outperform vanilla RAG on many NLP tasks, raising
9

questions about its real-world effectiveness. This paper systematically investigates when and why
GraphRAG succeeds, offering practical guidelines for its application. Specifically, we first conduct
an extensive analysis on existing benchmark datasets and identify that they inadequately assess
GraphRAG due to the lack of domain-specific corpora and oversimplified task granularity. Based on
the findings, we propose a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models in
terms of hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning.

A FREQUENTLYASKEDQUESTIONS(FAQS)
A.1 CODE ANDLEADERBOARD
To promote transparency and reproducibility, we have uploaded our code to GitHub at https:

A.2 WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE TASKS WITH VARYING COMPLEXITY?
Task complexity is critical for assessing GraphRAG models because their core value lies in navigating
interconnected knowledge structures and synthesizing latent logical relationships. Real-world chal-
lenges demand more than locating scattered facts since they require integrating hierarchical domain
expertise with ambiguous, context-dependent narratives to form coherent insights. By evaluating
models on tasks of varying complexity, from factual retrieval to creative generation, we expose
whether they truly leverage graph structures to reason like humans: inferring causality, resolving
conflicting contexts, and extrapolating insights beyond explicit data. Without measuring how models
17

handle complexity, evaluations risk overestimating their utility for real applications, where success
hinges on synthesizing interconnected concepts, not just retrieving them. Complexity-aware assess-
ment ensures GraphRAG systems are validated on their ability to map, traverse, and reason through
domain-specific ontologies, the very features that distinguish them from traditional RAG frameworks.
A.3 HOW TO CONTROL THE COMPLEXITY OF EACH TASK?
GraphRAG-Bench leverages structural information to control complexity. We begin by extracting
information from corpora to build ontologies or knowledge graphs. Taking the Novel dataset as an
example, we first construct a knowledge graph from the corpus, then form logic chains using relevant
triples from this graph. Then, we control difficulty by adjusting the number of involved triples and
the information span they cover. Specifically, we define question complexity through two dimensions:
Knowledge Breadth (measured by the count of triples required to answer a question) and Reasoning
Depth (measured by the number of inference hops between these triples). The relevant statistical
results are shown in Table 8.

Reasoning Depth 1.82 5.23 4.27 8.27
A.4 WHY CONSTRUCT TWO DATASETS FROM BOTH NOVELS AND THE MEDICAL CORPUS?
Including two distinct datasets, medical guidelines and unstructured novels, is essential to evaluate
GraphRAG models under conditions that mirror real-world knowledge ecosystems. Medical cor-
pora provide explicit, hierarchical relationships, testing a model’s ability to navigate rigid domain
logic and standardized protocols. Conversely, Novel corpora introduce implicit, context-dependent
dependencies, like socio-historical factors shaping character decisions, challenging models to infer
latent connections without predefined rules. This approach ensures the benchmark assesses both
precision in following formal hierarchies and adaptability in interpreting ambiguous, open-ended
contexts, critical for applications where models must integrate structured expertise with unstructured,
real-world narratives.
A.5 WHYNOTUSEOTHERFORMATS FORQUESTIONCONSTRUCTION?
In this paper, we aim to figure out in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits
for RAG systems. In other words, we care more about the retrieval and reasoning complexity of task,
instead of the task type or question format. It is because the specific task type or format (like QA,
multiple-choice, or fact-checking) doesn’t really change: 1) reasoning difficulty: the reasoning steps
the model needs to take, 2) retrieval difficulty: how to locate scattered information from the corpus.
Given a question of “What famous universities are in San Diego?”. Whether this is asked as: An open
QA question, or A multiple-choice question (e.g., “Is UCSD in San Diego? A) Yes B) No”), or A
fact-checking task (e.g., “Check this: UCSD has a campus in San Diego”)... doesn’t change the core
need: The RAG system must still find information about San Diego and reason to answer correctly.
A.6 WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF USING STAGE-SPECIFIC EVALUATION METRICS?
Stage-specific evaluation metrics are crucial because they provide granular insights into how well a
GraphRAG model performs at each phase of its pipeline, rather than relying solely on end-to-end
output metrics like answer accuracy. Traditional benchmarks often treat the entire process as a
“black box”, obscuring whether failures stem from flawed knowledge graph construction, suboptimal

retrieval, or weak reasoning. By designing metrics tailored to individual stages, such as graph
completeness during logic mining, retrieval relevance in evidence collection, or contextual coherence
in question generation, we isolate and diagnose weaknesses in specific components.
A.7 COMPARISON WITH EXISTING BENCHMARKS AND ANALYSIS PAPERS.
Existing studies (Han et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025) focus on architectural comparisons using
homogeneous datasets, missing how models synthesize hierarchical expertise and unstructured
narratives. To this end, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate GraphRAG models on deep reasoning. It features hybrid corpora (medical guidelines +
novels) with tasks of increasing complexity and stage-specific metrics to expose why models fail,
whether in graph construction, knowledge retrieval, or contextual synthesis. Leveraging this novel
benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG
systems and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.
B TAKEAWAYFINDINGS
In this paper, we not only build GraphRAG-Bench to evaluate existing GraphRAG systems, but more
importantly, we provide insightful recommendations for future GraphRAG research, as illustrated in
Figure 7.
PRIORITIZE PRECISE RETRIEVAL: Effective frameworks should focus on how to maximize key
information retrieval while minimizing redundancy. It’s critical to pinpoint the key facts needed to
answer a question, while at the same time avoiding pulling in unnecessary details. This keeps the
context clean and focused, which helps the model reason better and improves overall efficiency.
BUILD QUALITY GRAPHS,NOT JUST LARGE ONES: While GraphRAG forms knowledge graphs
(entities/relationships) for efficient searching, more relationships ̸= better performance. Optimal
graphs require tightly connected communities, which create denser structures rich in implicit multi-
hop knowledge – enabling faster graph traversal.
ACTIVELY MANAGE CONTEXT GROWTH: Unlike traditional RAG (fixed context via vector search),
GraphRAG retrieves entities, relationships, and raw text snippets, risking sudden context explosion
and hig reasoning costs. Future solutions need search boundaries to curb context growth and
significantly lower costs.

C BENCHMARKCONSTRUCTION
To address the critical limitations of existing RAG evaluation frameworks, we present a novel bench-
mark to assess GraphRAG systems through comprehensive task hierarchies and structured knowledge
integration. Specifically, our benchmark is constructed through six stages that systematically inte-
grate domain-specific logical hierarchies and contextual dependencies to enable precise control over
question difficulty.
C.1 CORPUSCOLLECTION
Existing benchmarks often rely on corpora with inconsistent quality and inadequate information
density, particularly in their inability to represent both loosely organized real-world knowledge
and tightly structured domain-specific hierarchies. In contrast, our benchmark addresses this by
constructing a corpus that integrates two complementary datasets: (i)Medical Dataset. We integrate
domain data from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines, which
provide standardized treatment protocols, drug interaction hierarchies, and diagnostic criteria. (ii)
Novel Dataset. We curated a collection of pre-20th-century novels (narrative fictions) from the Project
Gutenberg library, prioritizing lesser-known works to minimize overlap with pretraining data of
LLMs. These texts were selected based on their length and narrative ambiguity, ensuring they simulate
real-world documents with non-linear, inferential dependencies. These two complementary datasets
ensure the corpus balances unstructured, real-world ambiguity with domain-specific hierarchies,
enabling rigorous evaluation of both retrieval robustness and reasoning depth.
C.2 LOGICMINING
Raw text alone lacks explicit representations of the latent relationships that define real-world reason-
ing, such as causality, hierarchy, or contradiction. Existing benchmarks often treat these relationships
as implicit, leading to superficial evaluations of “multi-hop“ queries as mere fact aggregation. To
address this, we transform text into formalized ontologies using GPT-4.1, which codifies vertical
hierarchies (e.g., symptom → diagnosis) and horizontal dependencies (e.g., socio-economic factors
influencing medical outcomes). This ontology acts as a ground-truth map of domain logic, enabling
precise identification of what constitutes a reasoning step and how concepts interrelate. By making
these relationships explicit, we establish a measurable foundation for distinguishing factual retrieval
from genuine logical synthesis, a prerequisite for controlling question difficulty.

C.3 EVIDENCECOLLECTION
Real-world reasoning complexity arises not only from the number of “hops“ but from the structural
and semantic properties of the knowledge being traversed. Isolating evidence into localized subgraphs
(dense concept clusters) and multi-hop chains (logically linked sequences) allows us to quantify
difficulty through objective metrics like entity density, path length, and inferential distance. For
instance, a subgraph with high entity density tests a model’s ability to filter relevant facts within a
noisy context, while a long-chain dependency tests its capacity to maintain coherence across logical
steps. This stage ensures that “difficulty“ is not arbitrarily defined but rooted in the ontology’s
verifiable properties, aligning question design with the cognitive demands of real analytical tasks.
Crucially, this evidence extraction phase distinguishes our approach by ensuring that even simple
retrieval questions are anchored in contextually rich subgraphs, while complex reasoning tasks
demand traversal of interconnected chains that reflect real-world problem-solving, such as diagnosing
a patient by integrating symptoms, lab results, and comorbidities.
C.4 QUESTIONGENERATION
Questions are generated by aligning their cognitive demands with the structural properties of the
underlying evidence. Retrieval-focused questions target isolated subgraphs, requiring models to
recall clustered facts. Reasoning questions leverage short-range chains, demanding interpretation of
relational predicates (e.g., causality or contraindication). Summarization tasks synthesize disjointed
subgraphs into narratives, while creation questions extrapolate hypotheses from global graph topology
(e.g., predicting policy impacts by traversing regulatory, economic, and clinical subgraphs). Difficulty
is calibrated by the depth of contextual synthesis required—retrieval relies on localized subgraphs,
whereas creation necessitates integrating hierarchical, relational, and topological cues. The ontology’s
explicit logic ensures question complexity scales with measurable graph properties, like inferential
distance between chain endpoints, avoiding the ambiguity of hop-count-based metrics.
C.5 CHECK& CORRECT
To ensure the accuracy of both evidence and answers, we perform verification and correction. We
define the evidence validation process as follows: given the original corpus and the constructed
evidence, we assess whether the evidence can be logically derived from the corpus. Our validation
criteria are strict: given a question, if no evidence triple can be inferred from the corpus, the
corresponding question is discarded. Similarly, for answer correction, we check whether the provided

answer can be logically inferred from the evidence. This verification and correction process is
supported by advanced models combined with human checking for final confirmation.
C.6 REFINEMENT
We observe that some generated questions may be overly direct, lacking sufficient contextual informa-
tion, which may affect effective retrieval. To address this, we further enrich and refine the question by
incorporating relevant background knowledge. Specifically, for each question, we locate the corpus
segment from which the evidence was derived and employ GPT-4.1 to refine the original question
by integrating this segment. This ensures that each question not only retains the necessary logical
structure but also provides relevant background context, thereby enhancing the overall clarity and
rationality of the question.
D EXTENDINGGRAPHRAG-BENCH TONEWDOMAINS
In this paper, we used a medical dataset to represent domain knowledge in the initial version of
GraphRAG-Bench. The method we constructed the data can be used to extend the benchmark into
other fields, such as law and finance. For researchers who wish to add other domains in future work,
we provide some suggested methods.
For the legal domain, we offer the following suggestions: 1) CORPUSSELECTION: We suggest
collecting data from the following sources: a) EU Case Law which contains 29.8K EU court decisions,
mainly from the Court of Justice (CJEU), published in EUR-Lex. b) UK Case Law which contains
47K UK court decisions from the British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII) database. c)
US Case Law which contains 4.6M US decisions (opinions) from Court Listener, a web database
hosted by the Free Law Project. 2) DATAMININGMETHOD: We recommend a method that integrates
both ontology and logic chains. Ontology provides a structured representation of legal regulations
and judicial interpretations by defining entities, actions, relationships, and the conditions under which
specific laws apply. Logic chains, in parallel, capture the legal reasoning process and model potential
multi-hop relationships between different laws.
For the finance domain, we suggest the following: 1) CORPUSSELECTION: We recommend focusing
on publicly traded companies from the S&P 500 list for the period between 2015 and 2024. For
these companies, we can collect their annual reports, quarterly reports, and reports on unscheduled
events from the same period. These documents are primarily available in the EDGAR database.
2) DATAMININGMETHOD: We suggest using an ontology to map company information, such as
business structures and financial metrics, to a unified schema. It is worth noting that the financial
domain contains a large amount of numerical data, which may require further processing. The details
statistics of Legal and Financial Corpora are in Table 12.

Corpus statisticsWe first conduct a
statistical analysis of the composition
of the corpus from existing bench-
marks, as shown in Table 13. We
find that these benchmarks contain
a large number of redundant entities
and relations. Although some bench-
marks like UltraDomain have rela-
tively high average numbers of enti-
ties (170.6) and relations (73.2), their
average degree remains low (with a
maximum of only 0.86), indicating a
lack of effective connectivity among
entities. Further analysis reveals that
the average component size remains
small (e.g., 2.7 in UltraDomain and
MultiHop-RAG), and the proportion
of non-isolated entities is also low
(around 40%), suggesting sparse and
fragmented graph structures. Addi-
tionally, only a small fraction of enti-
ties have degrees greater than 3 (e.g.,
9% in UltraDomain), reflecting lim-
ited semantic aggregation. Such struc-
tural characteristics lead to low overall
information density, making it difficult to effectively support retrieval tasks based on graph structures.
These findings highlight the limitations of current benchmarks in terms of information organization
and provide a strong motivation for our benchmark design.
Based on the above analysis, GraphRAG-Bench is designed to provide benchmarks with richer
and more structured entity-relation graphs than existing datasets. In both the medical and novel
subsets, the corpus contains higher average degrees (1.05 and 2.27, respectively), larger proportions
of non-isolated entities (0.48 and 0.66), and increased average component sizes (3.15 and 3.99),
24

indicating more coherent and connected graph structures. These improvements address the sparsity
and fragmentation observed in prior benchmarks, and offer a more suitable foundation for studying
the impact of graph-based information organization in retrieval-augmented generation. This setup
enables controlled experiments for analyzing how different structural properties affect the behavior
and effectiveness of GraphRAG systems.
Questions statisticsWe first categorize questions for existing benchmarks based on a predefined
taxonomy of difficulty levels, with classification results shown in Figure 9. Our analysis reveals a
significant imbalance in the distribution of question levels across current benchmarks. Specifically,
UltraDomain focuses mostly on Contextual Summarize questions (97%), while HotpotQA mainly
contains Fact Retrieval questions (78.2%), lacking coverage of deeper logical reasoning tasks.
Although MultiHop-RAG balances Complex Reasoning and Contextual Summarize questions better,
it entirely lacks basic Fact Retrieval questions, making its evaluation coverage incomplete.
To address these limitations, GraphRAG-Bench introduces a carefully designed taxonomy of question
types to achieve more comprehensive evaluation coverage. We not only ensure a more balanced distri-
bution across the four core categories but also introduce a novel Creative Generation category, filling
a critical gap in assessing generative creativity which largely overlooked by existing benchmarks.
This multi-level question design enables GraphRAG-Bench to provide a more systematic evaluation
of both RAG and GraphRAG systems, offering unique advantages for analyzing model performance
across tasks with varying levels of cognitive
F EVALUATIONMETRICS
Retrieval PerformanceTo evaluate the retrieval performance of GraphRAG, we argue that an
effective system should both guarantee the completeness of retrieved information and reduce irrelevant
content. We introduce two corresponding retrieval-quality-based metrics as detailed below
•CONTEXTRELEVANCEmeasures how well the retrieved content aligns with the question’s intent.
It quantifies the semantic similarity between the question and the retrieved evidence, with higher
values indicating more focused and pertinent information. Specifically, it can be defined as:
CONTEXTRELEVANCE= 1
|C|
X
c∈C
R(c, Q,E),(3)
where C denotes the set of retrieved contexts, Q represents the question, E denotes the set of evidence,
and the operator R(·) determines whether a context c is relevant to the question Q and the evidence E.
•EVIDENCERECALLmeasures retrieval completeness by assessing whether all critical components
required to correctly answer a question are captured. Higher values indicate more comprehensive
evidence collection. The formal definition is as follows:
EVIDENCERECALL= 1
|R|
X
c∈R
1(S (c,C)),(4)
where R is the set of reference claims, and the operatorS(·) determines whether a claim c is supported
by the retrieved contextC, providing the condition for the indicator function1(·).
Generation Accuracy.After retrieval, a GraphRAG system is expected to generate accurate
answers based on the retrieved contexts. To evaluate the quality of the generation, we introduce four
key metrics: 1) LEXICALOVERLAP: Measures word-level similarity between the generated and
reference answers using longest common subsequence matching. 2) ANSWERACCURACY: Assesses
both semantic similarity and factual consistency with the reference answer. 3) FAITHFULNESS:
Evaluates whether the relevant knowledge points in a long-form answer are faithful to the given
context. 4) EVIDENCECOVERAGE: Measures whether the answer adequately covers all knowledge
relevant to the question.
•ROUGE-Lquantifies text similarity through n-gram overlap between generated and reference
answers, capturing both syntactic and semantic alignment (Lin, 2004).
•ANSWERACCURACYprovides a dual assessment of answer quality: 1) Semantic alignment:
Embedding-based similarity scores 2) Factual precision: Fine-grained statement-level verification

This combined approach ensures answers are both contextually appropriate and factually accurate.
AC=α·F C+ (1−α)·SS(5)
where α is the weight parameter, we set it to 0.75 by default. FC is the Factual correctness and SS is
Semantic similarity, they are defined as:



F C= 2· TP
TP+FP+FN ,
SS=cos(f i,c j),
(6)
•FAITHFULNESSspecifically targets hallucination risks by measuring claim-to-evidence alignment.
The metric calculates what percentage of answer assertions are directly supported by the retrieved
context, crucial for evaluating retrieval-grounded generation. The computation follows:
FS = |{c∈A|S(c, C)}|
|A| (7)
where FS is the faithfulness score, A is the set of claims in the response, C is the retrieved context,
andS(c, C)is a boolean function indicating whether claimcis supported by contextC.
•EVIDENCECOVERAGEevaluates answer completeness against reference standards. Rather than
simple overlap, it assesses whether all necessary knowledge components appear in the generated
answer, particularly important for complex queries requiring comprehensive responses. The formal
computation is as follows
Cov = |{e∈E|M(e, G)}|
|E| (8)
where Cov is the coverage score, E is the set of reference evidences, G is the generated answer, and
M(e, G)is a boolean function indicating whether evidenceeappears inG.
G ADDITIONALEXPERIMENTS
G.1 EXPERIMENTS ON MOREGRAPHRAGFRAMEWORKS
We evaluated a total of 11 GraphRAG frameworks in our study. Due to space constraints in the
main paper, only a subset of the results is presented there. This appendix provides the complete and
detailed results for all frameworks, which are shown in Table 9 and Table 10.
G.2 EXPERIMENTS ON OPEN-SOURCE MODEL
In our main experiments, we employ GPT-4o-mini as the default backbone model for generation.
To evaluate how well different GraphRAG frameworks adapt across generation models, we use
Qwen2.5-14B as the open-source model. The experimental results are presented in Table 11. Due to
time and resource constraints, we tested a representative subset of these models on Qwen2.5-14B.
We summarize the observations as follows.
When integrated with the open-source Qwen2.5-14B model, several lightweight GraphRAG frame-
works exhibit competitive performance. Notably, Fast-GraphRAG achieves the highest accuracy
(60.08%) and ROUGE-L (41.31%) in fact retrieval, as well as strong performance in creative genera-
tion (ACC 47.60%) on the Novel dataset. On the Medical dataset, LightRAG leads in Contextual
Summarize (ACC 69.37%) and creative generation (FS 70.84%), while HippoRAG2 obtains the
best ROUGE-L scores for both fact retrieval (33.92%) and complex reasoning (33.02%). These
results suggest that even under open-source settings, resource-efficient GraphRAG frameworks can
effectively leverage graph-structured context to support various generation tasks.
G.3 EXPERIMENTS ON GRAPH CONSTRUCTION EFFICIENCY
To assess the practical deployment costs of different frameworks, we evaluated the graph construction
efficiency on the Novel dataset. We used one book (approximately 56k tokens) as the input corpus

and recorded the construction time, total input tokens, and completion tokens during the indexing
phase. The quantitative results are presented in Table 15.
We summarize the observations as follows. The efficiency varies significantly across different
GraphRAG methods. Notably, KGP demonstrates the highest efficiency, completing the construction
process in just 32.01 seconds with the lowest total token usage (89,215). HippoRAG and Hip-
poRAG2 also perform efficiently, maintaining low time and token costs. In contrast, LightRAG
and the MS-GraphRAG incur much higher resource consumption. LightRAG requires over 710
seconds to index, while MS-GraphRAG consumes nearly 655,000 tokens. These results suggest that
lightweight frameworks offer a far more cost-effective solution for graph indexing, which is critical
for applications with limited time or computational budgets.

G.4 EXPERIMENTS ON THE IMPACT OFLLMSIZE
To investigate the dependence of GraphRAG performance on the underlying LLM capability, we con-
ducted experiments using the Qwen2.5 series (3B, 7B, and 14B) on the Medical dataset. We compared
Standard RAG against GraphRAG, employing HippoRAG2 as the representative GraphRAG method.
Since the graph index construction is an offline process, we utilized the same pre-constructed index
(generated by GPT-4o-mini) used in our main experiments across all model sizes. This experimental
design allows us to isolate the impact of model size specifically during the online generation phase.
The quantitative results are presented in Table 16.
GraphRAG exhibits a higher sensitivity to model capacity than Standard RAG. While RAG’s per-
formance remains relatively flat across scales (from Avg 56.13 to 59.10), GraphRAG demonstrates
substantial growth (from Avg 57.08 to 63.91), indicating a greater reliance on the model’s reasoning
ability to synthesize structural information. Notably, we observe a distinct performance inflection
point at the 7B parameter scale (Avg increasing from 57.59 to 61.50), suggesting that 7B serves
as a practical "minimum size" threshold where the model acquires sufficient reasoning power to
effectively leverage graph-based context.
G.5 EXPERIMENTS ONSCALABILITY WITHCORPUSSIZE
To evaluate the scalability of GraphRAG compared to Standard RAG across varying data volumes,
we conducted controlled experiments on the Novel dataset. We defined the corpus sizes based on
token counts calculated via tiktoken: Small (∼56k tokens, representing a single book unit), Medium

Large 1132k 58.04 43.20 62.43 47.19
(∼603k tokens), and Large (∼1132k tokens, representing the full dataset). We utilized HippoRAG2
as the representative GraphRAG method and compared it against Standard RAG across these scales.
The quantitative results are presented in Table 17.
The comparison reveals a critical insight regarding robustness. Standard RAG suffers significant
performance degradation as the corpus size increases. Notably, its accuracy in Complex Reasoning
drops heavily from 58.64% (Small) to 43.20% (Large). This supports the hypothesis that vector-based
retrieval is prone to capturing high-similarity but irrelevant noise as the search space expands. In
contrast, GraphRAG (HippoRAG2) exhibits remarkable stability, maintaining consistent performance
across all scales (e.g., Fact Retrieval remains steady at ∼60%). This confirms that the performance
stability is driven by the structural constraints of the graph (i.e., explicit entity and triple matching),
which effectively filter out the retrieval noise that tends to accumulate with increasing corpus size.

As discussed in previous work (Gao et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2025), RAG
models comprise three core components: indexing, retrieval, and generation, each with its specific
implementation details as presented in Table 18. Some explanation should be given to the content
in the “Knowledge Type“ column of the table.A knowledge graph is constructed by extracting
entities and relationships from each chunk, which contains only entities and relations, is commonly
represented as triples. A textual knowledge graph is a specialized KG (following the same construction
step as knowledge graph), which enriches entities with detailed descriptions and type information. A
tree structure formed by document content and summary.
Implementation Details of RAGWe follow the standard RAG paradigm: a retriever model first
retrieves relevant context from the corpus based on the given question, and then the question is
concatenated with the retrieved context to form a query for the generation model to produce the final
answer. Since existing RAG approaches often incorporate rerankers to improve retrieval quality, we
consider two baselines: RAG-with-rerank and RAG-without-rerank.
Implementation Details of GraphRAGWe evaluate several representative GraphRAG frameworks
on our benchmark, including:
• MS-GRAPHRAG(LOCAL): Microsoft-GraphRAG based on local retrieval granularity.
28
## PDF page 29

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026
• MS-GRAPHRAG(GLOBAL): Microsoft-GraphRAG based on global retrieval granularity.
• LIGHTRAG: a framework that enhances graph efficiency by leveraging optimized graph
structures and a two-stage retrieval pipeline.
• HIPPORAG: a framework inspired by the hippocampal memory indexing theory, integrating
large language models, knowledge graphs, and personalized PageRank to enable efficient
single-step multi-hop knowledge integration and retrieval.
• HIPPORAG2: a framework that achieves deeper contextual understanding by jointly incor-
porating conceptual (phrase-level) and contextual (passage-level) nodes.
• FAST-GRAPHRAG: a framework designed to improve retrieval speed and reduce computa-
tional cost through efficient graph-based querying.
• RAPTOR: a framework that constructs a tree structure through recursive embedding,
clustering, and summarization of text segments, enabling efficient information retrieval
across different levels of abstraction.
• STRUCTRAG: a framework that boosts knowledge-intensive reasoning of LLMs by dy-
namically restructuring scattered information into a hybrid, structured format at inference
time.
• KGP: a framework that improves multi-document question answering by constructing and
traversing a knowledge graph to formulate the right context for large language models.
• LAZY-GRAPHRAG: a framework that achieves a better cost-quality trade-off by using a
"lazy" approach to build a concept graph only at query time.
• KET-RAG: a framework that achieves a cost-efficient and high-quality Graph-RAG by
leveraging a multi-granular indexing approach combining a knowledge graph skeleton with
a text-keyword bipartite graph.
All of these GraphRAG methods construct graphs and refine retrieval strategies to boost RAG
system performance across various specialized tasks. Due to time limits, we only assess several
representative GraphRAG models. We will include more SOTA models, like ArchRAG (Wang et al.,
2025b) PIKE-RAG (Wang et al., 2025a) MedRAG (Zhao et al., 2025) PathRAG (Chen et al., 2025a)

H.2 CONFIGURATION OFGRAPHRAG MODELS
In our experiments, we maintained consistent conditions for fair comparison. Specifically, all
GraphRAG and RAG systems used the bge-large-en-v1.5 embedding model during retrieval stage,
and used a generation temperature of 0.7 during generation stage. For GraphRAG systems, given
the inherent differences in graph indexing, retrieval strategies, and generation mechanisms across
frameworks, we preserved their default configurations (including graph indexing, retrieval strategies,
and generation methods) without modification to assess their native performance. This approach
ensures both comparability across systems and realistic evaluation of their practical capabilities. The
detailed configuration parameters are following:

I RELATEDWORK
I.1 TRADITIONALRAGAND THEIRLIMITATIONS
The naive RAG systems (Lewis et al., 2020) operate through three key steps: knowledge preparation,
retrieval, and integration. During knowledge preparation, external sources such as documents,
databases, or webpages are divided into manageable textual chunks and converted into vector
representations for efficient indexing. In the retrieval stage, when a user submits a query, the system
searches for relevant chunks using keyword matching or vector similarity measures. The integration
stage then combines these retrieved chunks with the original query to create an informed prompt
for the LLM’s response. Recent advancements in RAG systems have moved beyond basic text
retrieval to structured knowledge integration Xiao et al. (2026; 2025); Chen et al. (2025b). Modern
implementations employ hierarchical architectures maintaining document organization via layered
retrieval processes (Chen et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024), while others enhance precision through
multi-phase retrieval mechanisms that first broaden then refine context selection (Glass et al., 2022;
Xu et al., 2023). Autonomous query parsing frameworks automatically break down intricate questions
into executable subqueries (Asai et al., 2023), complemented by context-aware systems that modify
retrieval tactics in real-time according to query complexity and intent (Tang et al., 2024; Sarthi
et al., 2024). These strategies advance naive RAG systems by improving context awareness, retrieval
accuracy, and handling complex queries.
Although researchers have extensively explored traditional RAG, there are still some unresolved
limitations due to the constraints of the data structure itself. (i) Vector database architectures limit
traditional RAG’s ability to handle multi-hop reasoning, as they retrieve information only from text
chunks containing anchor entities. While methods like query expansion (Mao et al., 2020) and
metadata enrichment (Wang et al., 2024a) attempt to improve complex query handling, they remain
constrained by the chunk-based knowledge structure that inherently disconnects related concepts.
This structural limitation particularly hinders domain-specific reasoning requiring logical synthesis
across distributed evidence. (ii) The chunking process sacrifices critical contextual relationships
between specialized terms and abstract concepts, despite techniques like real-time retrieval alignment
(Jiang et al., 2024) and external API integration (Lazaridou et al., 2022). Vector databases’ flat
organization fails to preserve hierarchical or conceptual dependencies essential for domain expertise
utilization, leaving models unable to reconstruct professional knowledge networks from fragmented
chunks. (iii) Vector similarity retrieval often overwhelms LLMs’ fixed context windows (OpenAI,
2023; Anthropic, 2024) with redundant content, exacerbating their limited capacity for long-range
dependency modeling. While strategies like context pruning (Arefeen et al., 2024) and LLM fine-
tuning (Luo et al., 2023) reduce input volume, they cannot compensate for the structural inability
to establish explicit connections between retrieved chunks. This fundamental mismatch persists
despite optimizations like sliding windows (Wang et al., 2024a), as vector-based approaches lack
mechanisms for relational reasoning.
I.2 GRAPHRAGAND ITSADVANTAGES
To address this, graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) (Peng et al., 2024; Procko &
Ochoa, 2024) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages external structured graphs

to improve LLMs’ capability on contextual comprehension (Han et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a).
Early efforts, like Microsoft GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024) and its variant LazyGraphRAG (Dar-
ren Edge, 2024), employ hierarchical community-based search and combine local/global querying
for comprehensive responses. Building on this, LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024) improves scalability
through dual-level retrieval and graph-enhanced indexing, while GRAG (Hu et al., 2024) introduces
a soft pruning technique to mitigate the impact of irrelevant entities in retrieved subgraphs and
employs graph-aware prompt tuning to help LLMs interpret topological structure. Further extending
these capabilities, StructRAG (Li et al., 2024) tailors data structures to specific tasks by dynamically
selecting optimal graph schemas, while KAG (Liang et al., 2024) constructs domain expert knowledge
using conceptual semantic reasoning and human-annotated schemas, which significantly reduces
noise present in OpenIE systems. These strategies used in GraphRAG models significantly improve
retrieval precision and contextual depth, enabling LLMs to address complex, multi-hop queries more
effectively.
GraphRAG offers several significant advantages over traditional RAG systems (Peng et al., 2024),
enhancing the capabilities of AI-powered information retrieval and generation. First, its graph-based
knowledge representation captures hierarchical relationships and multi-hop dependencies between
entities, enabling nuanced contextual reasoning and discovery of latent connections Yang et al.
(2026). This structured approach resolves ambiguity by evaluating multiple semantic paths during
query processing. Besides, the graph structure allows unified integration of structured databases,
semi-structured formats, and unstructured text within a single graph, supporting cross-modal queries
that combine textual, numerical, and multimedia data. This interoperability maximizes value from
heterogeneous organizational knowledge assets (Procko & Ochoa, 2024; Luo et al., 2024; 2025; Xia
et al., 2025). Third, users can audit decision pathways by visualizing entity relationships traversed
during retrieval. Combined with LLMs, this transparent architecture supports multi-hop logical
synthesis, critical for specialized domains like healthcare and finance (Procko & Ochoa, 2024; Han
et al., 2024).
I.3 EXISTINGBENCHMARKS ANDANALYSIS
It is crucial to identify the factors that are currently limiting GraphRAG’s real-world performance.
However, quantitatively and fairly assessing the role of graph structures in RAG systems is challenging.
Current benchmarks, including HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MultiHopRAG (Tang & Yang, 2024)
and UltraDomain (Qian et al., 2024), fail to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of graph structures
in RAG systems due to fundamental limitations in both their problem design and corpus composition.
A few studies, like DIGIMON (Zhou et al., 2025) and another analysis paper (Han et al., 2025), have
recently tried to analyze the effect of different GraphRAG models. Despite their effort, they mainly
focus on architectural comparisons using homogeneous datasets, missing how models synthesize
hierarchical expertise and unstructured narratives. To this end, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models on deep reasoning. It features
hybrid corpora with tasks of increasing complexity and stage-specific metrics to expose why models
fail, whether in graph construction, knowledge retrieval, or contextual synthesis. Leveraging this novel
benchmark, we systematically investigate the conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG
systems and the underlying reasons for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application.
J LIMITATION
While our benchmark advances GraphRAG evaluation by systematically addressing reasoning com-
plexity beyond traditional retrieval-centric paradigms, it inherits constraints inherent to its design
scope. Most notably, the framework operates exclusively within unimodal (text-based) contexts,
omitting the challenges and opportunities posed by multimodal data integration. Real-world applica-
tions of GraphRAG often necessitate synthesizing heterogeneous information types, such as visual
diagrams, tabular datasets, or sensor-generated temporal sequences, to resolve complex queries. This
limitation mirrors a broader gap in RAG benchmarking, as existing frameworks similarly neglect
multimodal interplay despite its growing practical relevance. Future iterations will expand this work
to incorporate multimodal evaluation, testing how graph-based retrieval and reasoning mechanisms
generalize to hybrid knowledge representations while preserving contextual fidelity across data types.

K BROADERIMPACT
Our work introduces a paradigm shift in how to comprehensively evaluate GraphRAG systems,
with broader implications for AI’s role in knowledge-intensive domains such as healthcare, legal
analysis, and scientific research. By rigorously assessing not only the outputs but also the structural
and procedural integrity of knowledge representation and reasoning, our benchmark advances the
development of AI systems capable of contextually grounded, logically coherent problem-solving.
This progress addresses a critical gap in current AI evaluation methodologies, which often prioritize
superficial fluency over semantic and causal fidelity, thereby risking the deployment of systems that
generate plausible but ungrounded or fragmented insights.
From a technical perspective, our framework establishes a precedent for holistic evaluation, encourag-
ing the AI community to move beyond answer-centric metrics and instead prioritize the traceability of
reasoning processes. This shift could catalyze innovations in graph-based knowledge representation,
fostering models that explicitly encode domain hierarchies, causal relationships, and contextual
dependencies, capabilities essential for real-world applications like clinical decision support or policy
analysis. For instance, by evaluating how faithfully a system traverses medical guideline graphs
to synthesize treatment recommendations, our approach incentivizes the development of reliable,
domain-aware AI, reducing reliance on opaque black-box reasoning.

In the preparation of this manuscript, we used a large language model as a writing assistant. Its main
role was to help improve our English writing, such as correcting grammar and refining sentences for
clarity and style. Additionally, it was used to help set up the initial format for several tables. The
authors made all final decisions on the content, carefully checking and editing all suggestions from
the model to ensure the scientific accuracy and integrity of this work.
